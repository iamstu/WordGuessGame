# WordGuessGame

This is a basic hang-man style game to show understanding of essential JavaScript functions

There is an array of words who's length is displayed at the bottom.
All words are a basic video game title.
Begin by pressing any letter key. Correct guesses will replace the spaces representing the word length while incorrect will be in its own array.
You have seven tries per word and the words will randomly be chosen upon either a correct guess or a loss of all tries.
The number of words remaining will update upon a correct guess of a previously un-guessed word.
All data fields will update upon relevant events such as loss, win, or quality of guess.
